# Eludris

A free and open source, federated, End-To-End-Encrypted social media platform made
in rust that's easy to deploy and configure while striving to be *truly **yours***.

Eludris tries to combine the best parts of other popular social media platforms
such as Discord, Reddit, Twitter and so on while not being one or the other.

## Deployment

We really recommend using the provided docker-compose as a quick way to get stuff
running, just edit your `Eludris.toml` to suit your needs then run

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Congratulations, you've now successfully deployed your Eludris instance! <img width="30em" src="https://github.com/eludris/.github/blob/main/assets/thang-big.png" />
